SethCMS
=======

A basic CMS that uses PHP to allow users to edit in-browser without an Admin panel.

This early version basically allows divs to have a class of 'editable' which will add a # symbol to the box which, when clicked, will pop up a TinyMCE editor to edit the text, then AJAX's the text into a .html file corresponding with the edited div.
